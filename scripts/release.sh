# Release script for shuttle
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/release.sh patch    # v2.0.0 → v2.0.1
#   sh scripts/release.sh minor    # v2.0.1 → v2.1.0
#   sh scripts/release.sh major    # v2.1.0 → v3.0.0
#   sh scripts/release.sh v2.5.0   # explicit version
#
# What it does:
#   1. Validates working tree is clean
#   2. Runs tests
#   3. Computes next version from latest git tag
#   4. Builds the local binary with that version
#   5. Creates a git tag
#   6. Pushes tag → triggers .github/workflows/release.yml → GitHub Release
#
# The CI release workflow handles cross-compilation and artifact upload.
